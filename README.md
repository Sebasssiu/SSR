✅ React       | React is a well known javascript library used to build scalable websites based on components in order to respect DRY.
✅ Webpack    	| Since react is build in diferrent modules, webpack brings everything together in a .js for web production.
✅ Babel	    	| Babel let us build websites in E6 javascript which is more confortable to be writing code in, instead of a normal module .js.
✅ EsLint     	| Checks the written code in order to make sure you're writing a readable code by other programmers to check your code out.
